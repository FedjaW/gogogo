**Difference between constants and immutable variables**
immutable variable is a variable so it has space in memory, memory that needs to be allocated. Immutable by a mechanism that is checking that no one is changing that variable.
In js a const is a immutable variable.

A constant will tell the compiler to copy the given initial value and paste it. (very simplified)
